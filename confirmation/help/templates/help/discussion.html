            A discussion will ask a question or give a topic for discussion pertaining somehow to the current activity.
            You can make as many entries as you like and see the entries that others have made. It's not a chat room,
            people don't have to be signed in at the same time to take part. It's also not exacly like an online forum.
            You don't write replies to specific posts, you just add your voice to the discussion. Normally, each entry
            you make will remain visible for as long as the activity is visible.

            There are three kinds of discussions: open discussions, semi-anonymous discussions and anonymous
            discussions. Each type of discussion provides various degrees of privacy for what you say. There will be a
            note on each disucssion page telling what kind of discussion it is.
        </p>

            In an open discussion everyone's name appears next to the entries he or she has made. Like participating in
            a classroom discussion, everyone knows what everyone else has said.

        In a semi-anonymous discussion the adults involved in the Confirmation program can see which candidate made
        which remark but the other candidates cannot.  This is meant for topics that may be a little more sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an anonymous discussion no one can see who made the responses and all the responses are recorded in the
        database as being from "Unknown User". This is meant for topics in which a candidate might prefer that no
        one knows what he or she wrote. Keep in mind, however, that nothing on the internet is completely private.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter which kind of discussion it is, inappropriate comments will be deleted and any threatening remarks
        will be reported to the proper authorities.
