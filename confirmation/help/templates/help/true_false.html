    <h2>True/False Pages</h2>

        <p>
            True/False questions are just like multiple choice questions except there are only two choices: True and
            False. Click the box next to the one you want to select and then click the "Submit" button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like multiple choice pages, True/False pages can either have a correct answer (2 + 2 = 5, True or False?),
            or be more of an opinion question (I like brussel sprouts. True or False?) If the question has a correct
            answer you will likely be told the correct answer after you make your selection but then you cannot change
            your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can change your answer to opinion questions but editing a True/False response works a little differently
            than what you might expect. Normally, to edit a response on this website you are taken to a special edit
            page for that type of response. There isn't much to do when editing a True/False response: if it's True, it
            gets changed to False and vice versa. Clicking the "Edit" button changes it right away -- there's no extra
            edit page!
        </p>
        <p>
            You can delete your answer but why would you want to do that? You'd just have to answer it again before you
            could go on. Might as well just click the "Edit" button.
