                Some activities require you to write out your response. This kind of activity will present you with a page
                that asks some kind of question, or gives some kind of instruction on what to write about and then provides
                a text entry box.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the activity your response may just be a quick answer of a word or phrase, or it may involve
                several sentences. Think about your response and type it into the text entry box on the page. Click on the
                "SUBMIT" button when you are finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you click the "SUBMIT" button your response will display for your review. If you see something you want
                to change you can click the "EDIT" button that appears. If you don't like it at all and want to start over
                again you can click the "DELETE" button. The "DELETE" button will not appear after you have completed the
                next activity in the sequence.

        You can use the set of buttons at the bottom to go back to the previous page, go on to the next page, or
        just go back to the summary page. The "BACK" and "NEXT" buttons will only appear if you can actually go
        there.
