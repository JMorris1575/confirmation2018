                Some pages just give instructions on what to do. It may be reading something or it may be something to do
                in life, like the Challenges in the Chosen book.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the nature of the instructions you may want to keep the page open while you are carrying them
                out, such as when they direct you to read a short passage from the bible, or you may want to leave the
                website entirely and come back later, for instance, if it will take a long time to complete whatever the
                instructions tell you to do.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img class="three columns u-pull-right" src="{% static 'images/illustrations/Professor-300px.png' %}"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        In either case, click on the "Finished" button after you have finished and the page will tell you the date
        and time when you finished. (Actually, only the date and time when you clicked the button -- computers don't
        know everything!)
    </p>
    <p>
        You can return to the page later and still see the instructions so that, if you think you might have missed
        something, you can check it out and complete it later.
    </p>
