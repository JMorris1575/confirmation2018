            <p>The Bible we Catholics use is a collection of seventy-three books, most of
                which are divided into chapters and the chapters divided into verses. This
                make thingss easier to find. We can't just use page numbers because every publisher prints the Bible
                differently.  This system for locating things in the bible was developed back around the
                thirteenth century and has been making it easier to find bible passages ever since.
                Here’s how it works:</p>
            <p>Suppose you see a sign at a sporting event that says Jn 3:16 and you want to look that up. Here’s
                how to break the code at its most basic level:</p>
            <div class="u-full-width">
                <h4 class="center-text">[book] [chapter] : [verse]</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The [book] in this case is ‘Jn’ which is an abbreviation for the gospel of John. The ‘3:’ tells you
        to look up chapter 3. Chapter numbers usually come before a colon (:) although some books use a
        comma (,) instead. In that case the notation would be Jn 3,16. Finally, the ‘16’ tells you to scan
        through chapter 3 until you come to verse 16. Most bibles have verse numbers printed just before
        each verse.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it’s a bit more complicated, such as when more than one verse is being referred to, or the
        passage in question crosses from one chapter to another or, worse yet, the passage is in bits and
        pieces throughout a section of the bible. Here is a chart showing some examples you might find and the
        meaning of the notation:</p>
    <table border="1" class="center-element">
        <colgroup>
            <col width="25%" />
            <col width="75%" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead valign="bottom">
        <tr>
            <th class="pad-override">Notation</th>
            <th class=>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody valign="top">
        <tr>
            <td class="pad-override">Jn 3:16</td>
            <td>The Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="pad-override">Jer 1:4-10</td>
            <td>Jeremiah, chapter 1, verses 4 through 10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="pad-override">Gen 1:1 - 2:3</td>
            <td>Genesis, chapter 1, verse 1 through chapter 2, verse 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="pad-override">1 Kngs 8:1-7, 9-13</td>
            <td>First book of Kings, chap. 8, verses 1-7 then skip to verses 9-13</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <div class="row">
        <img class="u-pull-right" height="300px" src="{% static 'images/illustrations/QuestioningBoy.png' %}" />
        <p>But what if you don’t know that ‘Gen’ means the book of Genesis, or where to find the First book of
            Kings? Bibles usually have a page near the front that gives you the abbreviations they use in that
            bible. Even if its not the same as the one you see in another book (or on the sign at the sporting
            event) it’s usually close enough for you to tell which book they are talking about. A bible will also
            have a table of contents telling you where to locate the beginning of each book.</p>
        <p>By the way, on this website we will always spell out the name of the book of the bible such as
            ‘Genesis’ or ‘1 Kings’ instead of using abbreviations just to keep things simple. But watch out, there
            is a difference between the Gospel of John (which we would call 'John') and one of the three letters
            of John (which we would call '1 John,' '2 John' or '3 John').</p>
        <p>Happy searching!</p>
