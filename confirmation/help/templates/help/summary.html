                Each activity has a summary page that gives, you guessed it, a summary of the activity and lists the things
                there are to do for that activity. Next to the name of each section is the status of that section. It will
                say "Completed" if it has already been completed, "Up Next..." if it is the one that can be done now, and
                "Pending" if it cannot yet be reached. You must complete the earlier sections before you can get to the
                later ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next to the status indicators is a column for buttons. The button next to the "Up Next..." section will say
                "DO IT...". Click that button to begin that part of the activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have completed a section the button will say "REVIEW IT...". Clicking that button allows you to go
                back and see what you answered in previous sections and possibly edit or delete your entry. This depends on
                the nature of that section. Sometimes you're just stuck with your answers. If you do delete your entry,
                however, you will have to re-do that section before going on. If you have already completed a later section
                you will not be able to delete an earlier response.

        At the bottom of the whole list is a "RETURN TO WELCOME PAGE" button that sends you back to the welcome
        page. Of course, you could just click the Holy Spirit image at the upper left corner of the page but it's
        good to have more than one way of doing things.
