                Multiple choice pages give you, well, multiple choices for your responses. Sometimes it is the sort of
                question that has only one correct choice, sometimes the question just seeks your opinion on something.
            </p>
            <p class="seven columns">
                If there is a correct answer to the question you will likely be told what that answer is after you make
                your selection. In this case, you will not be able to change your answer. If the answer is not given
                right away, however, you may be able to edit your choice.
            </p>

                Once you give an answer an edit button may appear depending on whether or not you have already been told
                the answer. After clicking the Edit button you will be allowed either to change or delete your answer.
                Of course, if you delete it, you will just have to do it over again.
