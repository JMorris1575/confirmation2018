                Multiple choice pages give you, well, multiple choices for your responses. Click the box next to the
                response you want to choose and then click the "Submit" button.

                Sometimes a multiple choice question will be like a quiz or test question, that it, it has only one
                correct choice.  Sometimes the question just seeks your opinion on something in which case you pick the
                one that best fits your opinion and there is no one choice that is correct.
            </p>

                If there is a correct answer to the question you will likely be told what that answer is after you make
                your selection. In this case, you will not be able to change your answer. If the answer is not given
                right away, however, you may be able to edit your choice.
            </p>
            <p class="seven columns">
                Once you give an answer an edit button may appear depending on whether or not you have already been told
                the answer. After clicking the Edit button you will be allowed either to change or delete your answer.
                Of course, if you delete it, you will just have to do it over again.
