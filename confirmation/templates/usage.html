            When you come to the website, either through the parish website www.StBasilCatholicChurch.org,
            or by using the link you were given in the invitation e-mail, you will first have to log in with the
            username and password you were given.

        <p class="nine columns">
            Once you are logged in you will come to the Welcome page that lists all of the currently available
            activities and shows how much you have completed in each one. Click the button next to each activity's
            name to enter that activity.
        </p>
        <p class="nine columns">
            You can return to the Welcome page at any time by clicking on the Holy Spirit logo in the upper left corner
            of each page.
        </p>

        When you enter an activity you will come to a Summary page that tells you a little about the activity, shows a
        list of the things that need to be done for that activity and where you stand on each one. It will say either
        "Up next..." which means it's the next one you can do, "Pending..." which means you haven't completed it yet, or
        "Completed" which means you have. The buttons next to each part you can enter will say either "Do It..." or
        "Review It...". The later parts will have no buttons next to them because you must complete the parts of an
        activity in sequence. You can't, for instance, do the fifth thing in a list before completing the fourth thing.
