Finding Passages in the Bible
=============================

The Bible that Catholics use is divided into seventy-three books, most of which are further divided into chapters. Each
chapter is further divided into verses. This system for locating things in the bible was developed back around the
thirteenth century because, before that, it was really hard to find what you were looking for, or to tell anyone else
where to find something. Here's how it works:

Suppose you see a sign at a sporting event that says Jn 3:16 and you want to look that up. Here's the basic pattern::

    <book> <chapter>:<verse>

That means the 'Jn' refers to the book of the bible, in this case the gospel of John is abbreviated by 'Jn.' The '3:'
tells you which chapter to look up. Chapter numbers come before a colon (:). Finally, the '16' tells you to scan through
chapter 3 until you come to verse 16. Most bibles have the verse numbers printed as little numbers within the text just
before the verse they refer to.

Sometimes it's a bit more complicated, such as when more than one verse is being referred to, or the passage in question
crosses from one chapter to another or, worse yet, is in bits and pieces throughout a section of the bible. Here is a
chart showing some examples you might find and the meaning of the notation:

+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Notation                | Meaning                                                                    |
+=========================+============================================================================+
| Jn 3:16                 | The Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16                                    |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Jer 1:4-10              | Jeremiah, chapter 1, verses 4 through 10                                   |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gen 1:1 - 2:3           | Genesis, chapter 1, verse 1 through chapter 2, verse 3                     |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 Kngs 8:1-7, 9-13      | First book of Kings, chap. 8, verses 1-7 then skip to verses 9-13          |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

But what if you don't know that 'Gen' means the book of Genesis, or where to find the First book of Kings? Bibles
usually have a page near the front that gives you the abbreviations they use in that bible. Even if its not the same
as the one you see in another book (or on the sign at the sporting event) it's usually close enough for you to tell
which book they are talking about. A bible will also have a table of contents telling you where to locate the beginning
of each book too.

By the way, on this website we will always spell out the name of the book of the bible such as 'Genesis' or '1 Kings'
just to keep things simple. But watch out, there is a difference between the Gospel of John (John) and one of the three
letters of John (1 John, 2 John or 3 John).

Happy searching!
