Deployment
==========

I just created a new website called **Confirmation18** on webfaction.com. It has a domain of
confirmation.jmorris.webfactional.com and has two apps: one, a Django 2.02 app called conf18, and another, a static app
called conf_static.

I also created a new Mailbox, called st_basil, and a new e-mail address:
st_basil_confirmation@confirmation.jmorris.webfactional.com which automatically forwards anything coming in to
FrJimMorris@SaintBasilCatholicChurch.org.

Using ``ssh jmorris@jmorris@webfactional.com`` I checked out the website and it is ready to go when I am ready to
deploy the website -- even if only for testing and comments.
