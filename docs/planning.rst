Planning the Confirmation18 Website
===================================

This document is meant to help me come to a more clear understanding of what I want the website to do, both for the
candidates and for the adult facilitators.

Once I have a clear idea of what I want it to do, the actual implementation should go more easily.

Overview
--------

This website is designed to give additional educational aspects to our current Confirmation program. Access to the
website will be through the parish website or by entering its url.  Candidates can log in to the website to complete
various activities which consist of:

* Bible Study Topics
* Extensions of Topics from the Chosen Program
* Versions of Topics from the Chosen Program Not Covered
* Discussion Topics (Optionally Confidential)
* Quick Quizzes of Various Sorts -- Trivia, Show Off Your Knowledge, etc.
* Surveys of Candidate Opinions or Beliefs or Suggestions (Optionally Confidential)

The "Optionally Confidential" activities are only confidential up to a point. Candidates will be informed that, although
their names will not be saved with their responses, no one is really anonymous on the web and, if need be for serious
matters, measures can be taken to determine who made certain entries. (Perhaps this can be implemented with a time-stamp
on each entry so that logs may help us discover the poster.)

Each activity may consist of instructions telling them what they need to do to complete the activity, questions for
short essay response, multiple choice or true/false questions.

A "Help" link at the top of the page (in the header) drops down to show links to pages explaining how to find entries in
the Bible, or information about the website. Other topics may be added as they occur to me.

For the Candidates
------------------

Access to the Website
+++++++++++++++++++++

Access to the website will probably most often be obtained through the parish website. Once clicking into the site an
individual will be prompted for the username and password I assigned them when I announced the opening of the site. This
can come through e-mail or at a Confirmation session for those whose e-mail addresses I do not have.

The Welcome Page
++++++++++++++++

Candidates who successfully log in are brought to a "Welcome" page which outlines the purpose of the site and lists the
various activities available. Next to each one is either the word "Ready," meaning they can start that activity any time
he or she is ready; "Finished," meaning he or she has finished all the parts of that activity; finally, either a
progress bar, if I learn how to do that, or a percentage indicating how much he or she has completed of that activity.

Clicking on the name of an activity brings him or her to the cover page for that activity which shows them, in more
detail, the pages of that activity which they have completed. A "Begin" or "Continue" button on that page brings them to
the next uncompleted page of that activity.

Activity Pages
++++++++++++++

.. _cover_page:

The Cover Page
**************

The cover page gives the name of the activity, an overview of what it is about and a summary chart of all the pages of
that activity and how many that person has completed. If they have not yet completed any pages there is a "Begin" button
which brings them to the first page of the activity. Otherwise it is a "Continue" button which brings them to the next
uncompleted page. There is also a "Return to Welcome Page" button which, you guessed it, returns them to the welcome
page.

Short Answer Essay Pages
************************

If an activity page requires an open-ended answer the user is brought to an essay page. This page gives instructions or
asks a question and supplies a text box in which they can write their response. When they click the "Submit" button
their response is displayed under the question of instructions. An "Edit Response" button activates allowing them to
change their answer. There may be some kind of limit as to when they can edit their response but I don't know what that
might be as yet.

Multiple Choice Pages
*********************

These pages display the questions and the possible choices in a box with radio buttons next to each choice. When they
pick a choice and click "Submit" they are brought to the next page which gives (and explains) the answer. They can go
back to the previous page, to see their answer, but they cannot change it. A "Continue" button brings them to the next
page of the activity.

True/False Pages
****************

These pages work just like Multiple Choice pages but are separated for the sake of consistency:  the True response
always coming first for instance. Again, the answer is given (and explained) on the next page and they cannot change
their answer.

Discussion Pages
****************

These pages display the discussion topic or question and all of the answers given so far. Depending on whether the
discussion is confidential or not the responses may or may not have the name of the individual making that response. The
responses are listed from earliest to latest so that the discussion makes sense when read from top to bottom. There may
need to be more than one page for each discussion. A candidate may get credit just for visiting the page or may need to
add something to the discussion to get credit, I haven't decided yet. It may depend on the nature of the discussion.

Logging Out of the Website
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is a Logout link in the header that appears on every page. Once clicked it logs the person out and brings them
back to the Login page.

I would like to figure out how to automatically log someone out after they have been away from the site for a time but
I don't yet know how to do that.

For the Adult Facilitators
--------------------------

Adult facilitators who successfully log in are brought to the same welcome page -- indicating their own progress
through the site, but they have an extra link in the menu, called "Candidates" they can use to monitor the progress of
their candidates and a "Feedback" link which allows them to give feedback on pending activities before they are
deployed. The "Candidates" menu drops down to reveal links either to a summary page, which displays the progress of all
their candidates, or each of their candidate's names which shows a more detailed summary of how that candidate has
responded so far.
