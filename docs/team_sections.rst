============================
Team Sections of the Website
============================

User Groups
-----------

There are four levels of users of the website:

*   Administrator
*   Supervisor
*   Team
*   Candidate

Candidates have access only to the Activity pages and Help pages.

Team members should be able to help with Activity creation by making comments on the creation pages but not to actually
edit them personally.

Team members should also have access to the work their candidates have completed. It may be sufficient to give them
access to the work of all candidates but to group the candidates under their respective team members.

Supervisors should be able to create content as well as do all of the things Team members can do.

Administrators, or superusers, have total access to everything on the website.
